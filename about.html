<div style="width:;"><h2>Alex Thompson - Founder, Snowboarder</h2>
<h3 class="info">Alex has had a passion for making videos since a young age, creating "box office" hits such as <i>The Hobbit Memories</i> and <i>My Side of The Mountain</i> it only made sense to turn his passion for videography into an outlet for snowboarding, skiing and mountain biking. When Alex isn't filming, editing or shredding, he is fishing or hunting as he exploits his passion for the outdoors.</h3>

<h2>Chris Eodice - Mountain Bike, Snowboarder</h2>
<h3 class="info">Ever since he can remember Chris Eodice has been on a bike. He gets sendy and even sometimes sketchy but that has helped him pursue a career in the sport. Racing enduro, Chris has "just a few" races under his belt. Not to metion the consideralble amount of time he has spent in Whistler. This make Chris a very well-rounded rider. In his free time Chris tends to build up his trail system or watches <i>How I Met Your Mother</i>.</h3>

<div style="width:;"><h2>Joe Hurlbert - Skier, Mountain Bike</h2>
<h3 class="info">When it comes to steeze, Joe is the king. With more than just a bag o' tricks, Joe brings raw awe to Snowcrest's videos. Apart from being one of the best skiers in Montana, Joe also mountain bikes...and shreds. He attempts drops that no one else on the team would do. And also builds lines that are second to none, when it comes to sketch. Joe really packs the pure thrills into Snowcrest that every viewer can enjoy.</h3>

<h2>Garrett Oleson - Skier</h2>
<h3 class="info">Garrett definately deserves more credit than what he is given. Attepting some of the most sketchy jumps and lines at an even crazier speed. Garrett, while not a park rat, can shred harder than most of the team. However he pays for this when he crashes. Mostly brutal, his crashes are unforgetable and help us really expiernce the miracle of life or lack of. In his free time Garrett can be found fishing or hunting. #squaw</h3>

<div style="width:;"><h2>Levi Long - Skier</h2>
<h3 class="info">Levi Long has been on skis nearly his whole life. Racing competitively, Levi shows determination to win and go as fast as he can. That is no to say he can't spice things up a bit though. Levi can also ride park and is'nt to bad at it. By being able to ride switch, Levi is already a natural born park rat. However he still favors a flag mapped course than rutted out terrain park. Levi hasn't been in any videos but definatly will during the upcoming season.</h3>

<h2>Morgan Ahmann - Skier</h2>
<h3 class="info">Although Morgan hasn't been in to many videos, he is still a valued part of the team. Morgan makes up the other half of the Ahnamm twins, Christian and him are quite similar in the way they ski but Morgan focuses on finding perfect lines and the secret poweder stash. Morgan also is an avid outdoorsman, partacking in sports such as fly-fishing and hunting. In his free time Morgan can be found tying flies or working hard building just about anything.</h3>

<div style="width:;"><h2>Christian Ahmann - Skier</h2>
<h3 class="info">Christian Ahmann is a fanatic when it comes to skiing. Rather than choosing to hit a large kicker in the park, he favors the more casual riding of powder. Which in turn makes him an excellent skier. However, on occasion, he will hit kickers just to give everyone an example to follow. Christian also mountain bikes, some of his fondest memories are of toddler him shredding up his driveway with his brothers. Last year Christian broke his thumb and hand sledding on a massive jump. That didn't stop him though. Just two days after he broke himself he went up to the mountain to shred some pow.</h3>

<h2>Daniel Cole - BMX, Snowboarder</h2>
<h3 class="info">Even though Daniel has never been in a video for his strong suit, he is still a solid part of the Snowcrest team. By offering outstanding support and having the ability to film, Daniel is greatly appreciated on and off the mountain. However snowboarding is not his main sport. Daniel rides BMX and is not to bad at it. Having learned a multitude of tricks over the years it's a wonder why there is no video with him riding...but mayber there is to come.</h3>

<div style="width:;"><h2>Micheal Hurlbert - Skier</h2>
<h3 class="info">Micheal is the king of crashes and risk taking. With more gut than his older brother, Micheal tends send big. Most of the time it pays off but when it doesn't...we will leave you to think about that. Micheal both skis and mountain bikes and shred on both. In his free time, Micheal builds road gaps and massive drops, with the help of his brother.</h3>

<h2>Greyson Ahmann - Skier</h2>
<h3 class="info">Greyson is an expert jump buider and filmer. Either setting up angle or building a sweet feature, he adds what's needed to the team. He has never appeared in a skiing video though. However, he is a master when it comes to powder. Spraying up fresh flakes and carving a path to the bottom. Greyson is a master on skis.</h3>
